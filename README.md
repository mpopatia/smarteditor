# SmartEditor
A text editor that provides thesaurus results and relevant information for user-typed content.

The editor was built by Musab Ahmed Popatia, Mohammed Fituri and Yasser El-Sayed for Carnegie Apps Hackathon 2015 held in Carnegie Mellon University Qatar.

The editor won the Best Technical Challenge Award.

#Techologies
The editor uses:

- QuillJS: https://github.com/quilljs/quill/
- jQuery: https://github.com/jquery/jquery
- Bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap
- Google Freebase API: https://developers.google.com/freebase/v1/topic-overview
- BigHugeLabs Thesaurus: http://words.bighugelabs.com

#Important
The Google APIs have been deprecated and so the editor does not function anymore.
